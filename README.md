Private Captcha is an independent, privacy-first, self-hostable Proof-of-Work CAPTCHA service made in EU.

## About

Instead of asking users to solve complex puzzles or track their behavior, Private Captcha solves an invisible cryptographic task in the background. The system automatically adjusts the task difficulty, ensuring smooth access for real users while making it too costly for bots to attempt. Cryptographic task provides equal security regardless of bot's intelligence level, making it effective even as AI technology improves. Additionally, Private Captcha does not use cookies or track visitors and is fully GDPR-compliant that makes it easy to use for organizations that do business in EU.

### Features

- adaptive challenge difficulty (including various configuration options)
- optimized backend API endpoints (low resource requirements)
- lightweight, customizable widget (including "invisible" version)
- usage statistics (backend)
- privacy-focused, no behavior tracking or PII processing

### Built with

- _Go_ for backend (API and Portal)
- _Javascript_ (inevitably) for client widget, including WASM workers (where possible)
- _Postgres_ for "business" data (accounts, properties etc.)
- _ClickHouse_ for "operational" data (difficulty scaling, statistics etc.)
- TailwindCSS for Portal (backend)
