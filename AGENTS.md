## General

- This project is a Golang monolith with internal parts in `pkg/` directory, main executable in `cmd/server`, JS widget code in `widget/` and Portal frontend code in `web/`. All dependencies get embedded into the final Golang binary.
- Instead of using `go`, `npm` or any other standard tooling, only use targets defined in the `Makefile` with appropriate names (e.g. `init-` for setup, `build-` for building and `test-` for testing)
- Add only the most important comments, prefer adding logs where necessary instead of comments
- If you're not sure how to run something, look for examples in `Makefile`, CI workflow `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` or dockerfiles in `docker/`
- If you change any external Go packages, run `make vendors`

### Databases

- we use Postgres and ClickHouse as databases
- we are using golang-migrate as a library for migrations and we run them ourselves via `pkg/db/init.go`
- base DB initialization scripts are in `pkg/db/migrations/init/`

#### Postgres

- Postgres migrations are in `pkg/db/migrations/postgres/` and queries are in `pkg/db/queries/postgres/`
- We use sqlc (config in `pkg/db/sqlc.yaml`) to codegen plain SQL into golang source code. After changing queries or migrations, run `make sqlc` in the root to regenerate the Go source code.
- you can verify the sqlc queries/migrations using `make vet-docker`
- we use generated Go code for Postgres via `pkg/db/business_impl.go`

#### ClickHouse

- ClickHouse migrations are in `pkg/db/migrations/clickhouse/` and queries are written in Go code in `pkg/db/timeseries.go`
- we verify ClickHouse queries by writing integration tests for functionality that requires them
- we use ClickHouse database functionality through our own interface `TimeSeriesStore` (with in-memory stub implementation `MemoryTimeSeries`)

### Server

- Server (entrypoint in `cmd/server/main.go`) has logical parts of API, Portal and background worker (running maintenance jobs)
- handlers and routes for API part of the server are setup in `pkg/api/server.go` and `pkg/api/server_enterprise.go`
- handlers and routes for Portal part of the server are setup in `pkg/portal/server.go` and `pkg/portal/server_enterprise.go`
- maintenance jobs are defined in `pkg/maintenance/` package and scheduled in `cmd/server/main.go`

## Environment setup

- Use `make init` to initialize everything for development

## Building instructions

- To build widget script for testing, run `make build-widget-script`
- To build portal/web JS code, run `make build-js` followed by `make copy-static-js`
- To build main server executable, run `make build-server` (or `make build-server-ee` if Enterprise Edition changes were made)

## Testing instructions

- To run all Go unit tests, run `make test-unit`
- To run JS widget tests, run `make test-widget-unit`
- To run a single Go integration test, run `make test-docker-light TEST_NAME=<your-test-name>` (prefer running a single test for debugging). Docker is required.
- To run all Go integration tests, run `make test-docker-light`. Docker is required.
- Do not use underscores in Golang test names
- To get unit tests code coverage, run `make test-unit-cover`
- To get integration tests code coverage, after running integration tests, open `coverage_integration/` directory in repository root
- For exact HTTP routes to endpoints always check how they are setup in `server.go` and `server_enterprise.go`
- Always make sure all unit and integration tests pass before sending a PR
